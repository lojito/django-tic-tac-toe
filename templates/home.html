          Hi! Have you ever played the Tic-Tac-Toe game on a 4x4 board? Well, today
          is your lucky day! With this version you will have more chances of winning
          but also of losing too. As with the 3x3 version the goal is to to play
          your mark on 4 squares forming either a horizontal, vertical or diagonal
          straight line. You will play against the computer and your mark will be
          represented by Cristiano Ronaldo. The computer's mark will be represented
          by Lionel Messi. Ready for the battle? What are you waiting for? Sign up
          and start playing!
